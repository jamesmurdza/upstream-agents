# Building AI Agent Interfaces with the Background Agents SDK

Coding agents like Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode were originally designed for local-first CLI usage, and integrating them into cloud applications comes with a whole set of challenges. These agents execute code, read and write files, and run shell commands—you don't want that happening on your server. And since agents can run for minutes or longer, serverless functions will time out before they finish.

The Background Agents SDK solves both problems. It gives you a unified interface for running AI coding agents in isolated Daytona sandboxes, where they can execute safely and persist beyond the lifetime of any single request.

## Introducing the Background Agents SDK

The Background Agents SDK is a TypeScript library that lets you run long-running AI coding agents from serverless applications. You create a sandbox, clone a repo, and start a task:

```typescript
import { Daytona } from "@daytonaio/sdk"
import { createSession } from "background-agents"

const daytona = new Daytona({ apiKey: process.env.DAYTONA_API_KEY })
const sandbox = await daytona.create()

// Clone a repo and set up a working branch
await sandbox.git.clone("https://github.com/user/repo.git", "/home/daytona/repo")
await sandbox.git.checkoutBranch("/home/daytona/repo", "fix-auth-bug")

// Start the agent in the repo directory
const session = await createSession("claude", {
  sandbox,
  cwd: "/home/daytona/repo",
  env: { ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY },
})

await session.start("Refactor the auth module")
```

The agent is now running in an isolated sandbox with your repo cloned into it. To use a different agent, change `"claude"` to any of the supported agents: `"codex"`, `"gemini"`, `"goose"`, `"opencode"`, or `"pi"`.

## Long-Running Agents

Coding agents can run from a few minutes to much longer. For a serverless application, we need to be able to reconnect to running agent sessions to check their status later.

When you start a session, save the sandbox ID (`sandbox.id`) and session ID (`session.id`). Later, you can reconnect:

```typescript
const sandbox = await daytona.get(sandboxId)
const session = await getSession(sessionId, { sandbox })

const { events, running } = await session.getEvents()
for (const event of events) {
  if (event.type === "token") process.stdout.write(event.text)
  if (event.type === "tool_start") console.log(`\n[Tool: ${event.name}]`)
}
```

The SDK tracks which events you've already seen. Each call to `getEvents()` returns only the new ones.

## Event Types

Since every agent has its own output format, the SDK normalizes them into a common event structure:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `token` | Text output from the agent |
| `tool_start` | Agent started using a tool (includes tool name and input) |
| `tool_delta` | Streaming output from a tool |
| `tool_end` | Tool finished (includes output) |
| `end` | Agent completed the task |
| `agent_crashed` | Agent process crashed |

Here's what the events look like when an agent edits a file:

```typescript
{ type: "token", text: "I'll update the auth module..." }
{ type: "tool_start", name: "edit", input: { file_path: "src/auth.ts", ... } }
{ type: "tool_end", output: "File updated successfully" }
{ type: "token", text: "Done. The auth module now..." }
{ type: "end" }
```

## Saving to Git

When the agent finishes, push the changes:

```typescript
if (!running) {
  await sandbox.git.push("/home/daytona/repo", "x-access-token", githubToken)
}
```

You can also create a PR using the GitHub API:

```typescript
import { Octokit } from "octokit"

const octokit = new Octokit({ auth: githubToken })

await octokit.request("POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls", {
  owner: "user",
  repo: "repo",
  title: "Refactor auth module",
  head: "fix-auth-bug",
  base: "main",
})
```

A security benefit of using Daytona to manage the git repo is that the GitHub access token is not stored in the sandbox, which prevents the agent from making any destructive or unwanted changes.

## Adding New Agents

The SDK uses a pluggable registry. Each agent adapter:

1. Installs and runs the agent using its CLI
2. Parses the agent's JSON output into normalized events
3. Maps tool names to a standard format (e.g., `Write` → `write`, `Shell` → `bash`)

## Conclusion

Sandboxes make AI coding agents practical for cloud applications. They give you isolation—agents can execute code without risk to your infrastructure. They give you persistence—agents keep running even when your serverless functions time out. And they give you control—changes stay in the sandbox until you explicitly push them.

The Background Agents SDK handles the complexity of managing these sandboxed agents across multiple providers. You get one interface for Claude, Codex, Gemini, and others, with normalized events and simple session management.

If you're building on top of AI coding agents, it might save you some time.
