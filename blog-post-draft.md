# Building Cloud Coding Agents with the Background Agents SDK

Coding agents like Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode were originally designed for local-first CLI usage, and integrating them into cloud applications comes with a whole set of challenges. The Background Agents SDK is a solution that lets you start and manage long-running AI coding agents using Daytona sandboxes.

Since the agents are running in sandboxes, they can safely execute code, run shell commands, and modify files without affecting your infrastructure. The sandbox persists beyond the lifetime of any single request, so agents can run for as long as they need. And changes stay contained until you explicitly push them to your repository.

## Introducing the Background Agents SDK

The Background Agents SDK is a TypeScript library that lets you run long-running AI coding agents from serverless applications.

First, create a Daytona sandbox and clone your repo:

```typescript
import { Daytona } from "@daytonaio/sdk"
import { createSession } from "background-agents"

const daytona = new Daytona({ apiKey: process.env.DAYTONA_API_KEY })
const sandbox = await daytona.create()

await sandbox.git.clone("https://github.com/user/repo.git", "/home/daytona/repo")
await sandbox.git.checkoutBranch("/home/daytona/repo", "fix-auth-bug")
```

Then create a session and start the agent:

```typescript
const session = await createSession("claude", {
  sandbox,
  cwd: "/home/daytona/repo",
  env: { ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY },
})

await session.start("Refactor the auth module")
```

The agent is now running in the sandbox with your repo cloned into it. To use a different agent, change `"claude"` to any of the supported agents: `"codex"`, `"gemini"`, `"goose"`, `"opencode"`, or `"pi"`.

## Long-Running Agents

Coding agents can run from a few minutes to much longer. For a serverless application, we need to be able to reconnect to running agent sessions to check their status later.

When you start a session, save the sandbox ID (`sandbox.id`) and session ID (`session.id`). Later, you can reconnect:

```typescript
const sandbox = await daytona.get(sandboxId)
const session = await getSession(sessionId, { sandbox })

const { events, running } = await session.getEvents()
for (const event of events) {
  if (event.type === "token") process.stdout.write(event.text)
  if (event.type === "tool_start") console.log(`\n[Tool: ${event.name}]`)
}
```

The SDK tracks which events you've already seen. Each call to `getEvents()` returns only the new ones.

## Event Types

Since every agent has its own output format, the SDK normalizes them into a common event structure:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `token` | Text output from the agent |
| `tool_start` | Agent started using a tool (includes tool name and input) |
| `tool_delta` | Streaming output from a tool |
| `tool_end` | Tool finished (includes output) |
| `end` | Agent completed the task |
| `agent_crashed` | Agent process crashed |

Here's what the events look like when an agent edits a file:

```typescript
{ type: "token", text: "I'll update the auth module..." }
{ type: "tool_start", name: "edit", input: { file_path: "src/auth.ts", ... } }
{ type: "tool_end", output: "File updated successfully" }
{ type: "token", text: "Done. The auth module now..." }
{ type: "end" }
```

## Pushing to Git

When the agent finishes, push the changes:

```typescript
if (!running) {
  await sandbox.git.push("/home/daytona/repo", "x-access-token", githubToken)
}
```

You can also create a PR using the GitHub API:

```typescript
import { Octokit } from "octokit"

const octokit = new Octokit({ auth: githubToken })

await octokit.request("POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls", {
  owner: "user",
  repo: "repo",
  title: "Refactor auth module",
  head: "fix-auth-bug",
  base: "main",
})
```

A security benefit of using Daytona to manage the git repo is that the GitHub access token is not stored in the sandbox, which prevents the agent from making any destructive or unwanted changes.

## Adding New Agents

The SDK uses a pluggable registry. Each agent adapter:

1. Installs and runs the agent using its CLI
2. Parses the agent's JSON output into normalized events
3. Maps tool names to a standard format (e.g., `Write` → `write`, `Shell` → `bash`)

## Conclusion

Sandboxes make AI coding agents practical for cloud and serverless applications. They give you isolation, persistence, and scale. Agents can securely execute code, run for long periods beyond the span of serverless functions, and store the updated code until it is pushed to version control. With the Background Agents SDK, you can run any CLI agent in a cloud sandbox in a few lines of code.
